This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us.

This code of conduct outlines our exceptations for all those who participate in or the ColoredCow-Portal community.

We invite all those who participate in our community activities to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Creating a Welcoming and Inclusive culture

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.

## Excepted Behaviour

The following behaviours are excepted and requested of all community members:

* Be friendly and patient.
* Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
* Be considerate. Your work can be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
* Be respectful.Members of the ColoredCow-Portal community should be respectful when dealing with other members. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel comfortable or guarded is a productive one.
* Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others.
* When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and ColoredCow-Portal is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
