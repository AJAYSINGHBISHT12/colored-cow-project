## Creating a Welcoming and Inclusive culture

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.

## Excepted Behaviour

The following behaviours are excepted and requested of all community members:

* Be friendly and patient.
* Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
* Be considerate. Your work can be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
* Be respectful. Members of the ColoredCow-Portal community should be respectful when dealing with other members. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel comfortable or guarded is a productive one.
* Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others.
* When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and ColoredCow-Portal is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## Guidelines for chat room

1. Write an effective daily progress report

A daily progress report is an internal glimpse into your day, and it serves a good purpose. All you need to do is take your manager by the hand and walk him through your day. This gives you a better sense of how you’re pacing things. Additionally, you can learn how to get better at your job.

Just as weekly reports dive into a weekly review, writing daily reports will cover a complete review of your day. These looks into:

* ### The Past:

A quick recap of what covered in the entire day(notable achievements of the day + challenges encountered).

* ### The Present:

This will cover about what you are presently working on?

* ### The Future:

Plans for the coming day.

So you’re willing to give a snapshot of your day. The real question is – when and how? Answer to that is simple, Just post your snapshot at the end of the day in our chat room.
